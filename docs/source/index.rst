THUNER - Thunderstorm Event Reconnaissance
-------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to THUNER's documentation!
===================================

Welcome to the Thunderstorm Event Reconnaissance (THUNER) package!
THUNER is a flexible toolkit for multi-feature detection, tracking,
tagging and analysis of events in meteorological datasets. The intended
application of the package is to the tracking and analysis of convective
weather events. If you use this package in your work, consider citing
the following papers;

- Leese et al. (1971), doi: 10.1175/1520-0450(1971)010<0118:AATFOC>2.0.CO;2
- Dixon and Wiener (1993), doi: 10.1175/1520-0426(1993)010<0785:TTITAA>2.0.CO;2
- Whitehall et al. (2015), doi: 10.1007/s12145-014-0181-3
- Fridlind et al (2019), doi: 10.5194/amt-12-2979-2019
- Raut et al (2021), doi: 10.1175/JAMC-D-20-0119.1
- Short et al. (2023), doi: 10.1175/MWR-D-22-0146.1

When designing a tracking based research project involving THUNER,
consider performing sensitivity tests using these alternatives.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for instructions on installing and running the 
package.

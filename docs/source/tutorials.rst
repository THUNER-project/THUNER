Tutorials
========================================================================

Most of the tutorials presented in this section are also available as
`scripts <https://github.com/THUNER-project/THUNER/blob/main/thuner/test>`__ 
and `notebooks <https://github.com/THUNER-project/THUNER/blob/main/demo>`__ 
in the `THUNER Github repository <https://github.com/THUNER-project/THUNER>`__. 
New users should begin with the :doc:`tutorials/gridrad` tutorial, as it explains
core THUNER features and design ideas in greater depth than the other tutorials.
